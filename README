Boxes to BEANs conversion feature module for Drupal 7.

"All your sites should be full of BEANs!"

This module allows site administrators to move easily from the boxes
to bean for editable blocks.  This module requires the bean module[1]
and features[2].  Once you have enabled the bean_boxes module you can 
run the conversion script. In your document root run the following command:

drush scr sites/all/modules/bean_boxes/scripts/convert-boxes.php

This script will convert all of your boxes to beans and update all
of your contexts to use the newly created beans.

FAQ
Why are beans better than boxes?
Boxes are treated like configuration, which makes it easy to export
them to features, but it is annoying when users start overriding them.
BEANs are entities and are treated like content, which means you can
deploy them with the deploy module[3].

Why should I care about bean? I love boxes.
I used to love boxes too, until I started doing feature reverts as part
of the standard deployment process.

The 7.x-2.x branch of boxes is actually bean with some of the boxes UI,
so soon you'll be using bean anyway.  Don't belive me? Check the changelog
http://drupalcode.org/project/boxes.git/blob/refs/heads/7.x-2.x:/CHANGELOG.TXT

You suck I'm going to keep using boxes!
That's a statement, not a question. I never said you have to use bean, I just 
think it is a better module. You can keep on using boxes. You can still run 
PHP4 with Drupal 4.7 today, but that doesn't mean it is a good idea. I heard 
Windows 98 will run on older hardware without too. I'll leave you to watch 
Juaraic Park, feel free to email me and tell me how cutting edge that CGI is.
